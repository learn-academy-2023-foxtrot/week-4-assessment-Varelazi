# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: IV

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is the focus of using objects to code. For example, Ruby is a coding language that uses object-oriented programming to function. It is different than functional programming because object-oriented programming uses objects as well as less functionality. In other words, functional programming uses more functions and functionality. Ex: In JavaSciript, in order to capitalize a string in an array, which uses functional programming, you need to find the index of the word hou wish to capitalize and you use toUpperCase. While object-oriented programming allows you to call on the string you want to capitalize and use .capitalize

Researched answer: A style of programming with the use of objects closely linked with methods. Object-oriented programming uses objects and methods while functional programming uses functional factors like variables and functions. 

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: I am not sure what an implicit return means. 

Researched answer: An implicit return means that a function is returned without using the word return. Ruby uses p in methods instead of return. 

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is where you write all your logical code. It starts with a def, do, if, etc and always ends with a end. 

Researched answer: Blocks are enclosed in do / end statements or between brackets {}. Blocks are functions that can be passed into methods. 

4. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby has you would use the value name and in square brackets [] whichever hash you wish to call on. Ex: cat[:name]

Researched answer: Values in a hash van be accessed using bracket notation. After the has name, type the key in square brackets.

5. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: I am not sure, but I would assume it is the version of which ever console you are using is on. The latest updated version. 

Researched answer: A system designed to manage installments of Ruby on the same device.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: A testing unit before developing the actual code. A software practice which encourages tests to be run before writing your code. Ex: Jest

2. PostgreSQL: Open source database which stores data for many web, mobile, and analytic applications. 

3. CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete. Used to describe user interface that allows for viewing, searching, and changing information using forms and reports.
